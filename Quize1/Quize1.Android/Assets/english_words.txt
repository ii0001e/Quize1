The big time
Hit the jackpot
Make a bundle
go Dutch
Nest egg
At all cost
Break the bank
Crack of dawn
When pigs fly
Elephant in the room
Have a tiger by the tail
Lion's share of smth
Egghead
Couch potato
Eat one's words
Chew the fat
Hot potato
Take smth with a pinch of salt
Cry over split milk
Top dog
Be ahead of time
Pressed for time
In the blink of an eye
On the spur of the moment
Like clockwork
Around the clock
Lighting-fast
As right as rain
Huge
Bolt from the blue
A blessing in disguise
Break a leg!
Face like thunder
Snow white
Easy does it
